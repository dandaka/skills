## Leaderboards Launch

We just dropped Leaderboards, so now you can flex (or get humbled) in three ways: climb the ROI rankings to prove you grow bags better than the rest, top the Absolute Gains board if you're stacking raw profit, or dominate the Streak Score by chaining wins like a trading machine. We also made profiles way more fun — upload a pic and pick a username so people see you, not some soulless wallet string. And yeah, if you hit the top of a leaderboard, you unlock the right to mint your own OG Trader Card with a special design. Go check where you stand and cause some chaos @everyone @Member

## Partnership: Trendle x Brevis x Primus

Trendle x Brevis x Primus

we've been getting one question more than any other:

"How can I trust the attention index?"

today, we're answering it

We partner with Brevis and Primus to make attention index zk-verifiable!

If you want a deeper dive into how we make the Trendle attention index zk-verified and trustless, we've just dropped a full article breaking it all down

## App Update: Leaderboards + Limits

TRENDLE APP UPDATE

this update is mostly about one thing: who's actually good at trading attention

If you're consistently right, you'll start climbing
If you're not… the board will tell you

What's live now:

- global leaderboards ranking all traders
- visible tiers with shareable cards: top 10% / 3% / 1% / 0.01%
- profiles so your PFP + nickname show up on the board
- limits bumped to $50

If you make it to the top tiers, share your card on X and tag trendleFi
We'll notice and loudest traders get rewarded
